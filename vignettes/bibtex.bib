               appropriate test for the analysis of a 2 $\times$ 2 table. In
               contradiction to an earlier paper, the author now argues the
               case for the use of Fisher's exact test. It is noted that all
               test statistics for the 2 $\times$ 2 table have discrete
               distributions and it is suggested that it is irrational to
               prescribe an unattainable fixed significance level. The use of
               mid-P is suggested, if a formula is required for prescribing a
               variable tail probability. The problems of two-tail tests are
               discussed.",

  abstract = "Classical algorithms aiming at identifying biological pathways
              significantly related to studying conditions frequently reduced
              pathways to gene sets, with an obvious ignorance of the
              constitutive non-equivalence of various genes within a defined
              pathway. We here designed a network-based method to determine
              such non-equivalence in terms of gene weights. The gene weights
              determined are biologically consistent and robust to network
              perturbations. By integrating the gene weights into the classical
              gene set analysis, with a subsequent correction for the
              ``over-counting'' bias associated with multi-subunit proteins, we
              have developed a novel gene-weighed pathway analysis approach, as
              implemented in an R package called ``Gene Associaqtion
              Network-based Pathway Analysis'' (GANPA). Through analysis of
              several microarray datasets, including the p53 dataset, asthma
              dataset and three breast cancer datasets, we demonstrated that
              our approach is biologically reliable and reproducible, and
              therefore helpful for microarray data interpretation and
              hypothesis generation.",

              interactions has grown by nearly 600\% and the number of
